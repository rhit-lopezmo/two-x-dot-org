# Templ Starter Template

This is a starter template for making websites with Templ.
It uses a component approach where both behavior (JS files) and styling (CSS files) are located adjacent to the component they are related to.


This template also has hot-reload setup through the use of Air. Running `make` will trigger the hot-reload.
I recommend running `make gen-templ` in a different terminal before starting so any changes to the .templ file will be generate the .go file automatically, leading to Air picking up the changes and reloading the server.
